FunctionX-Nano
Overview
FunctionX-Nano is an open-source model designed to map natural language processing (NLP) prompts to programming functions, identifying the best-matching functions and their optimal parameters based on the input prompt. This lightweight tool aims to bridge the gap between natural language and executable code, enabling developers to integrate NLP-driven automation into their workflows.
Features

NLP-to-Function Mapping: Interprets natural language prompts and matches them to relevant functions.
Parameter Optimization: Automatically identifies the best parameters for the matched functions based on the prompt context.
Lightweight and Extensible: Designed to be fast and adaptable for various use cases.
Open Source: Freely available for community contributions and improvements.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rodyrahi/functionx-nano.git
cd functionx-nano


Install dependencies (assuming Python-based, adjust as needed):
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If specific dependencies are required (e.g., transformers, spacy), they will be listed in requirements.txt.

Set up the environment:

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
Configure any additional settings (e.g., model weights, API keys) as specified in the configuration file (to be added).



Usage

Prepare a Prompt: Write a natural language prompt describing the desired function, e.g., "Calculate the square of a number."
Run the Model:python main.py --prompt "Calculate the square of a number"


Output: The model will return the matched function (e.g., a Python function like square(num)) and suggested parameters (e.g., num=5).

Example
$ python main.py --prompt "Sort a list of numbers in ascending order"
Output:
Matched Function: sort_list
Parameters: list=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5], order='ascending'
Result: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]

How It Works
FunctionX-Nano uses NLP techniques to parse and understand user prompts. It then matches the prompt to a predefined set of functions using a combination of semantic analysis and similarity scoring. The model optimizes parameters by extracting relevant entities or constraints from the prompt. (Detailed architecture to be added as the project develops.)
